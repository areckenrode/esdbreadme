[change in raw data structure | series change | number of files changed | etc.]  

**Did we download all the published data? **
[e.g., select 70 out of more than 100 series]

**Is all the data we downloaded available for online query on IDEA?**
[e.g., source download included regions, which we did not post | we download and process but don’t post, so querying is only possible by contacting Data Services | etc.]

**Did the source back-date (revise) data?**


**URL or other document that announced the release: * *

#ACQUISITION AND PRE-PROCESSING

**Instructions for the pre-update check per step three in the First Analyst Procedures document:**
•	In the <S:\ESDB\Sources\~First Analyst Resources> folder, run the SAS program called <Pre-Update- Find series used in EADS applications>. You’ll need to change the source ID at the top of the program, but then just hit run.
•	This will output an Excel file to the source Documentation folder with information on the series from the source that are used in the application. When processing data from the source, be sure to track those series and alert those responsible for each application if a series they need is dropped.

**Instructions for acquiring the data:**
[Instructions for acquiring the data should include guidance from the organization’s homepage (in case direct links don’t work later]
  
1.	at URL, click on…
a.	[screenshot with annotations if necessary]
2.	etc.

**Data pre-processing instructions (if applicable): * *
[Pre-processing should be minimal. If the pre-processing steps can be done in the program then they should be.]
1.	Unmerge cells...
a.	[screenshot with annotations if necessary]
2.	etc.

**Folder(s) from which SAS programs read data (except /mappings/): * * 
[e.g., /raw data/  |  other] 

**List of mapping files and respective mapped columns: * *
mapping series.xlsx – original column -->  series_id
mapping countries.xlsx – original column --> country_id
etc.

#PROCESSING

**Processing instructions: * *
1.	Run EG <XXX imports> to create a SAS dataset from the Excel data sets. [First Analyst Procedures step 6]
a.	You need to import XXX data files, XXX mapping, XXX series.
2.	Run the <194fix> program to convert the data into ESDB format.  [First Analyst Procedures step 9]
a.	Export the <check means.xlxs> file and compare it to the raw data.  Save a copy in the \Documentation\ folder.  The SAS macros should export this file for you.  [First Analyst Procedures step 9]
b.	Pause the fix program to update the mapping files as needed. Reimport via EG. [First Analyst Procedures step 7]
c.	Pause the fix program to update the series and subsector series files as needed. Reimport via EG. [First Analyst Procedures step 7]
3.	Run the standard first analyst checks [First Analyst Procedures step 10]
4.	Fill out the ‘ESDB Source Update’ Google Form [First Analyst Procedures step 13]
5.	Update the source licensing information [First Analyst Procedures step 14]
6.	Update planner [First Analyst Procedures step 15]
